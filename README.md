# spacecraft

I've Developed a program that translates commands sent from Earth into instructions understood by the spacecraft. 
The spacecraft navigates through the galaxy using galactic coordinates, represented by x, y, z coordinates 
(x for east or west location, y for north or south location, and z for distance above or below the galactic plane).

Functionality:
1> Move the spacecraft forward/backward (f, b): The spacecraft moves one step forward or backward based on its current direction.
2> Turn the spacecraft left/right (l, r): The spacecraft rotates 90 degrees to the left or right, changing its facing direction.
3> Turn the spacecraft up/down (u, d): The spacecraft changes its angle, rotating upwards or downwards.
